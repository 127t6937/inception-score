# inception-score (compatible with Tensorflow 1.7)
While the canonical OpenAI implementation of calculation of "Inception Score" is no longer compatible with new releases of Tensorflow,
a new implementation of the "Inception Score" metric for evaluation of GANs is provided. It also fixed a bug proposed by [https://github.com/openai/improved-gan/issues/29](https://github.com/openai/improved-gan/issues/29).
